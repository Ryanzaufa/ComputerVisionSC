# ComputerVisionSC
Repository for Computer Vision assignments from Startup Campus. In this repository i have 3 file ipynb from Google Colab about my Computer Vision assignments

# 01
In the first file, I did digital image processing, Max pooling, Min pooling, Average pooling and CLAHE. I explain and compare the results of these processes.

# 02
And in the second file, I do Transfer learning using CNN-based Pre-trained Models. I create a model class to define the model I will use, set device to CUDA, define hyperparameters, call the model, create frozen layers function, get the dataloader, define loss function and optimizer, train the model and display the performance of the model. I also retrained the model using frozen layers and then compared with the previous results.
